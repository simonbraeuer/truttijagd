npm run test:e2e:ui           # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:headed       # Watch tests run in browser
npm run test:e2e:chromium     # Chrome only
npm run test:e2e:mobile       # Mobile devices only
```

**Coverage**: 80+ E2E tests covering:
- Game initialization and UI rendering
- Gameplay mechanics and scoring
- Pause/resume and game state management
- Performance benchmarks (FPS, load times)
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA, mobile touch)
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
